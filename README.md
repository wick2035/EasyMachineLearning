##  50 machine learning modules.

For each module, we will summarize from four sections:
1, Function 
2, mechanism 
3, unique advantage 
4, code

And these four sections are basically summarized from the paper.

It is possible to see how each module claims to be lightweight, all with little added computing cost. And the unique advantages are all the same. Because the general papers are modified and updated on the basis of predecessors, the environment at that time may be light. So don't worry about it, just use it. Add it to your own network, and if there is an improvement, you can specifically look at the article of this module. If that doesn't work, replace the module and sew up a new one. There's always one that works for you.

If you want to know more about it, you can Google academic search papers in detail. If you don't want to see it, just add the code to your model and run with it.
